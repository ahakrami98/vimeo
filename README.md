# YouTube Clone Project Documentation

### Demo: [Vimeo](https://vimeo.amirossein.tech/)

## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the YouTube Clone project developed for the Software Design class [ Dr.Karegar ] . The project aims to replicate the core features of YouTube, allowing users to search and view videos and channels. It leverages modern web technologies to deliver a user-friendly and engaging experience.

## Useability

The YouTube Clone project addresses the need for a simplified video discovery and viewing platform. It allows users to search for videos and channels, view media content, and explore the available video library. While the project does not include features such as commenting and authentication, it provides a basic yet functional interface for users to search and consume video content.

## Technologies Used

The YouTube Clone project utilizes the following technologies, frameworks, and libraries:

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used as the foundation of the project's frontend.
- React Router DOM: Enables routing and navigation within the application, ensuring proper rendering of components based on the requested routes.
- Material UI: A UI component library that provides pre-designed components, styles, and themes, enhancing the visual appearance and user experience.
- Emotion Style: A library for writing CSS styles with JavaScript, enabling easy styling and customization of components.
- Rapid API: An API platform used to fetch video and channel data, providing access to the necessary information for search and display purposes.
- Axios: A JavaScript library for making HTTP requests, employed for communicating with the Rapid API and retrieving data.

## Architecture and Infrastructure

The YouTube Clone project follows a modular architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability. The frontend is built using React components, organized in a reusable and structured manner. React Router DOM handles the navigation and routing aspects, ensuring that the appropriate components are rendered based on the requested routes.

The project interacts with the Rapid API to fetch video and channel data. Axios facilitates the communication between the project and the API, allowing the retrieval and display of search results.

## Deployment on the Web using Vercel

To deploy the YouTube Clone project on Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Create a Vercel account: Sign up for a Vercel account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) if you haven't already.

2. Install the Vercel CLI: Install the Vercel command-line interface (CLI) globally on your local machine by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

3. Build the project: Ensure that you have the project's dependencies installed by running the following command in your project's root directory:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Next, build the project using the build tool of your choice. For example, if you are using create-react-app, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command will generate the optimized production build of your project.

4. Deploy to Vercel: Once the build process is complete, navigate to your project's root directory and deploy the project to Vercel using the following command:

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

   The Vercel CLI will guide you through the deployment process. You may be prompted to log in to your Vercel account and select the project name.

5. Configure the deployment settings: During the deployment process, Vercel will provide you with various configuration options. Ensure that the following settings are correctly configured:

   - Root directory: Specify the directory where the build files are located. This is typically the `build` or `dist` directory.
   - Build command: If prompted, provide the build command needed to generate the production build of your project. For example, `npm run build`.
   - Environment variables: If your project requires any environment variables, set them accordingly in the Vercel deployment settings.

6. Deploy the project: Once all the settings are configured, confirm the deployment to proceed. Vercel will upload your project's build files and deploy them to a unique URL.

7. Access the deployed project: After the deployment is successful, Vercel will provide you with the URL where your project is deployed. You can access your YouTube Clone project on the web using this URL.

   Example URL: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

Ensure that your YouTube Clone project includes all the required dependencies, including React, React Router DOM, Material UI, Emotion Style, and Axios. These dependencies should be specified in your project's `package.json` file.

Note: The deployment steps provided above assume that you have a basic understanding of the Vercel platform and have set up your project's configuration accordingly.

## Major Components

### Search Bar

The search bar component allows users to enter keywords or phrases to search for videos and channels. It triggers the search functionality and displays the search results.

### Video Listing

This component presents the search results for videos, showcasing relevant details such as the video title, description, thumbnail, and view count. Users can click on a video to view its contents.

### Channel Listing

The channel listing component displays the search results for channels, including relevant information such as the channel name, description, and subscriber count. Users can explore the channel's content by selecting a specific channel.

### Media Viewer

This component provides an interface to view the selected video or media content. It presents the video player, allowing users to play, pause, seek, and control the playback of the video. Created using React player library.


In conclusion, the YouTube Clone project delivers a simplified video discovery and viewing experience, allowing users to search for videos and channels and view the associated media content. By utilizing React, React Router DOM, Material UI, Emotion Style, Rapid API, and Axios, the project offers a user-friendly interface and efficient data retrieval from the API.
